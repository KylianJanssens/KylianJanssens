# Hello, I'm Kylian Janssens!

I recently completed a Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp at Le Wagon, where I gained valuable skills in web development. My journey into the world of programming has allowed me to explore various languages and technologies, with a strong focus on:

- Ruby
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

I am particularly passionate about web development and have been working extensively with the Ruby on Rails framework to build web applications. My experience with Rails has given me the ability to create robust, user-friendly web applications.

I am currently actively seeking opportunities as a Junior Web Developer. I am enthusiastic about expanding my knowledge in programming and open to learning new languages and frameworks. I am eager to bring my skills to a team and contribute to exciting projects.

If you are interested in collaborating or want to learn more about my work, please feel free to reach out. Let's connect and explore the endless possibilities of the web development world!

Looking forward to new challenges and exciting projects.
